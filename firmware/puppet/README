This example print "Hello World!" message out the "UART port" and then do loopback
It used bitbang for TX and HW serial for the RX side. This is because I haven't
able to find where the HW serial TX route to. Maybe there are some pinmux
setting that needed to change.

baudrate: 9600
TX pin:   blue led (left of audio port)
RX pin:   unpopulated header J2 pin 2.
