# VXIS VS2828 Note

- USB3 video controller that designed for webcam with custom 8051 core
- When booting in ROM mode, device enumerate as `Sunplus Innovation Technology Inc. SPCA2610 PC Camera`

## 8051
- Memory Map
    - Instruction bus
        - 0x0000 - 0xbfff: Mask ROM
        - 0xC000 - 0xffff: External SPI flash
    - XDATA
        - 0x0000 - 0x0bff: ???? RAM?
        - 0x2000 - 0x37ff: Peripheral Registers
- SPI FW
    - begin 2 byte must match magic [0x89 0x26]
    - ROM will then call function in SPI at 0xc006. This function in the original firmware basically setup callhooks then return
    - There is a mode to jump directly to begining of flash but I not sure how to trigger this yet. (check function at 0x27f6)


- interrupt vector maybe custom.
    - 8051 have serial interrupt at 0x23 but looking at the ROM dump, this address over lap with Timer 1 interrupt. Could be that this interrupt is move or the code doesn't use it
- SFR
    - P0,P1,P2,P3 doesn't seem to route to any external GPIO pin (only check LED + unpopulated header)
        - flipping bits in P3 seem to cause chip lock up
    - SCON, SBUF
        - Serial interface seem to setup in the ROM code. But when trying to write to Serial, I don't get any output on any of the pins. Checked all pins with scope.
    - Look like standard 8051 SFR map.
- External Interrupt (IE0)
    - wire to external interrupt controller?
    - Vector can override if address at 0x0310 set
    - Interrupts type bit field is at 0x01ce

## Callhooks
- 0x0306 - main loop hook
- 0x030c
- 0x0308 - Serial init hook 
- 0x0310 - IE0 interrupt override. Take over the IE0 vector
- 0x0312 - IE0 interrupt extention
- 0x031a
- 0x0324
- 0x033e
- 0x0340
- 0x0346
- 0x0348
- 0x0374 - override for something something i2c write
- 0x0376 - override for something something i2c read
- 0x03ac - call begining of main loop. call at ROM:0xa7fa
- 0x03b8
- 0x03c4
- 0x03d6
- 0x03da
- 0x03de
- 0x03f8
- 0x040a
- 0x040c
- 0x0420
- 0x0432

## UVC custom control
Custom UVC control that allow writing to flash and access external data (XDATA)
- 0x2 - XDATA address
- 0x3 - XDATA set/get value
- 0x7 - flash something?
- 0x8 - flash something - cmd
- 0x9 - flash isp enable / status
- 0xd - flash erase sector
- 0xe - flash read write address
- 0xf - flash read/write buffer - get read - set write to flash
- 0x16 - flash write/read 64bytes
- 0x17 - flash - read data after cmd
- 0x18 - flash chip erase
